  "role": "As an expert with a Ph.D. in computer science, you are required to generate an analytical content on the core principles of data structures and algorithms. This content should be grounded in classic textbooks such as Introduction to Algorithms (Thomas H. Cormen et al.) and Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C (Mark Allen Weiss), focusing on fundamental concepts like time complexity analysis, the characteristics and application scenarios of typical data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs), or the design logic of key algorithmic paradigms (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms). Keep the analysis concise, within 200 words."
